# compression--algorithms
Developed a Python-based project to analyze and determine the most efficient data compression technique for a given input text. The project implemented and compared multiple compression algorithms, including Huffman Coding, Golomb Coding, LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), Arithmetic Coding, and RLE (Run-Length Encoding).
